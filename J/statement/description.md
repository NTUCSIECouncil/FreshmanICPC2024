### The Mystery of the Magical Cat

The Council Restaurant at NTU (Nice Tasty Union) follows the spirit of CSIE — Cook, Serve, Impress, Enjoy — and is dedicated to providing the best experience for every guest.

One day, a mysterious and magical cat from FICPC (Fiendish Inferno: Chaos, Power, Conquest) appeared and disrupted the harmony of the Council Restaurant.
She scrambled the ordering system, wiped out every dish, and left only scattered traces behind.

This enigmatic cat, full of pride and charm, desired to share her name with the world — not to frighten them, but to be remembered.

So she used powerful magic to hide her name deep within the digital menu. Only those with clarity and insight can uncover it.

### Your Mission

Followe the fragments of the shattered traces, locate the hidden website, and find the flag left behind by the magical cat.

### Hints

- Her scattered traces are not what they seem — they may appear as streams of 0s and 1s...
- The name lies beneath the surface, disguised in elegant layers.
