NTU CSIE builds a kingdom in Minecraft, and since itâ€™s in Minecraft, everything is made up of 1-meter square blocks, and each square cannot be subdivided. Now, they have found a useless area in their territory with a square area of side length $n$ meters. This area is represented by a horizontal line, where each meter extends outward by $a_i$ meters at the i-th meter. They hope to build the largest possible rectangular garden within this area. However, the garden's size might be quite small, so NTU CSIE can use a superpower at most once, which allows them to select any position $i$ and change the extension from $a_i$ meters to $c$ meters. The task is to determine the maximum possible area of the rectangular garden that can be achieved under these conditions.
