The first line of the input contains three integers $N, W, H$.

The second line contains $N$ integers $h_0, h_1, \dots, h_{N-1}$, representing the number of floors each building has.

The last line contains two integers $A, B$, representing the buildings where you and the enemy sniper are.

- $2 \leq N \leq 3\times 10^6$
- $1 \leq W, H, h_i \leq 10^8$
- $0 \leq A, B < N$
- $A \neq B$
