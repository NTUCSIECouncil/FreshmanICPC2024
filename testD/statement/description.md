TL;DR

Specifically, we know that the city has $N$ buildings standing side by side. Every building has the same width $W$ and every floor has the same height $H$. Also, you know how many floors each building has. Thanks to your partner, the enemy's location is exposed, too.

To shoot from building A' roof to building B's roof, the bullet will start from the center of building A' roof floor to the center of building B' roof floor, without any buildings blocking the path. Also, the bullet is so small that it won't be blocked by the corner of the buildings. See the figures below.
