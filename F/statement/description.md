#### Task Description
It's a sweltering summer in Long Island and the Camp Half-Blood is once again holding Capture the Flag. Throughout the years, the pine tree guarding the border of the camp has grown exponentially, so colossal that it's decided to be the next battle field of the contest.  
As a demigod who yearns for the glorious victory, you must navigate through branches to find the golden leaf, which is hidden and compressed. Only then you can retrieve the correct flag planted on it.

#### Objective
