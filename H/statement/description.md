You have $n$ coins arranged in a circle, all initially facing heads up. In each operation, you can choose any $k$ consecutive coins and flip them simultaneously.

Determine the number of distinct ways to make all coins face tails up after exactly $t$ operations.

Two sequences of operations are considered the same if one can be transformed into the other by reordering the operations.
