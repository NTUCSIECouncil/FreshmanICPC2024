Please output $M$ lines. Each line should contain two integers $a$ and $b$, separated by a single space. Ensure that $a$ and $b$ satisfy the constraints in the problem description. 

If your output exceeds $M$ lines, contains any unexpected characters, or if the numbers fail to meet the problem constraints, you solution will be marked as "Wrong Answer" on the testdata.
