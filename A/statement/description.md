One day, Charlie Smith sent a mysterious set of messages to Ivy Evans:

> ChallengingProblemsInspireSolutions

> SmartMindsCollaborate

> InventingTheNextBreakthroughs

> ElevatingHumanityThroughTechnology

At first, Ivy was puzzled. But being as sharp as she was, she quickly realizedâ€”it was an **Acrostic** using the initials of their names!

Intrigued, Ivy decided to reply with her own acrostic message. However, in her excitement, she got a little carried away... her reply was way too long.

Can you help Charlie to decode the secret message hidden in Ivy's reply?
