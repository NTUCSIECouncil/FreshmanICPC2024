The first line contains an integer $T$ â€” the number of messages in Ivy's reply.

The $i$-th line of the next $T$ lines contains a string $S_i$, representing the $i$-th message in Ivy's reply.

Let $|S_i|$ denote the length of string $S_i$, and let $S_{i,j}$ represent the $j$-th letter of string $S_i$.

Constraints:

- $T = 21$
- $1 \leq |S_i| \leq 10^6$
- $S_i$ consists only of English letters (both uppercase and lowercase), i.e., `a-z` and `A-Z`.
- $S_{1,1} = \texttt{'W'}$
- $S_{2,1} = \texttt{'e'}$
- $S_{3,1} = \texttt{'l'}$
- $S_{4,1} = \texttt{'c'}$
- $S_{5,1} = \texttt{'o'}$
- $S_{6,1} = \texttt{'m'}$
- $S_{7,1} = \texttt{'e'}$
- $S_{8,1} = \texttt{'T'}$
- $S_{9,1} = \texttt{'o'}$
- $S_{10,1} = \texttt{'F'}$
- $S_{11,1} = \texttt{'r'}$
- $S_{12,1} = \texttt{'e'}$
- $S_{13,1} = \texttt{'s'}$
- $S_{14,1} = \texttt{'h'}$
- $S_{15,1} = \texttt{'m'}$
- $S_{16,1} = \texttt{'a'}$
- $S_{17,1} = \texttt{'n'}$
- $S_{18,1} = \texttt{'I'}$
- $S_{19,1} = \texttt{'C'}$
- $S_{20,1} = \texttt{'P'}$
- $S_{21,1} = \texttt{'C'}$
