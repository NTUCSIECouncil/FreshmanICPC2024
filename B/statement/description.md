As you stare into the depths of the black hole, you feel an unusual pull—a strange attraction that draws you closer. No matter how near you get, the black hole seems to protect something, shrouded in mystery. As you carefully observe the edges of the black hole, you notice something odd, a subtle clue that hints at a hidden message waiting to be uncovered.

For those brave enough to venture into its depths, the first hint is subtle: The image’s mass feels too large for what it should be, and something within is compressed, obscured from direct view. But black holes distort more than just light—files, too, can be hidden in their grasp.

Hint: The black hole's mass is immense. Is it possible that it's not what it seems? Maybe you need to check the file's type for further clues.
