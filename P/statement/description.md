Professor P, a renowned and strict professor from the Cats-Supervised Innovative Engineering (CSIE) department, is famous for his iconic course Introduction to Cats Permutation. During one of his lectures, he shared the following memorable quote:

> **Look at the student on your left, then look at the student on your right. One of you will fail.**

While preparing for his classes, Professor P came across an interesting Cat Permutation problem: Given $n$ cats, each with a unique size-based number $1, 2, \ldots, n$, how many permutations exist such that no two consecutive numbers appear in an increasing order from left to right?

For example, when $n=3$, the valid permutations are $[1, 3, 2]$, $[2, 1, 3]$, and $[3, 2, 1]$, while the invalid permutations are $[1, 2, 3]$, $[2, 3, 1]$, and $[3, 1, 2]$.
