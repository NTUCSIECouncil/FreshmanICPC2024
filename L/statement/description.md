Your friend, **Betts**, is obsessed with fantasy baseball. He manages multiple teams across different platforms, tracks player stats religiously, and makes strategic trades to stay ahead.  

With so many baseball statistics accounts, Betts should have different passwords for each one. But managing that would be a nightmare, especially since he logs in multiple times a day. Instead, he came up with a **“foolproof” system**: using **one ultra-secure password** for all his accounts.  

To keep it safe, he built a **ChatBot** that reminds him of his password when needed. But Betts is no rookie—he designed it to be **secure**, ensuring no one else can easily access it.  

You've warned him that relying on a single password is a **huge risk**, but he refuses to change. So, as a **fun challenge** (and maybe to prove a point), and also being an CSIE student ( who must/should be good at prompt engineering ), you decide to test his ChatBot’s security.  

🔗 His ChatBot site is here [https://v0-ollama-chat-frontend-two.vercel.app/](https://v0-ollama-chat-frontend-two.vercel.app/)  

**Can you crack it and uncover the one password that rules them all?**  

Hint: The password is in the format `CSIE{...}`
