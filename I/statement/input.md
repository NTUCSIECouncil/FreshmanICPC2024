The input consists of three lines:

1. The first line contains a single integer $n$.
2. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n$, which represent the gasoline you can add at each station.
3. The third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \cdots, b_n$, which represent the distence between the $i$-th and the $(i+1)$-th gas stations.

- $2 \leq n \leq 10^6$
- $\forall i : 0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $\forall i : 1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9$
