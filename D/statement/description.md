欲しけりゃくれてやるぜ…
探してみろ
この世のすべてをそこに置いてきた"`

"My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it...
Go and find it!
I left everything in this world there."
— Gol D. Roger, King of the Pirates

Following the clues inscribed on the chest, you are led to an old, locked library. Now, using all the knowledge you've gained, you must solve the puzzles, uncover the key, and unlock the ***One Piece***, taking the final step toward becoming the Pirate King!
