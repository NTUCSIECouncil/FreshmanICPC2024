Now, let's take a step up in difficulty from a plus b problem.

You are given two integers $N$ and $M$. Your task is to construct $M$ distinct pairs of integers $(a, b)$ such that $a + b = N$.

Two pairs are considered distinct if either $a$ or $b$ (or both) differs. For example, $(3, 2)$ is distinct from $(2, 3)$.

**Warning: Ensure that both $a$ and $b$ are integers satisfying $0 \leq a, b \leq 10^9$.**
